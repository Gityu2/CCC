            "content": "The rampaging flood that has devastated most parts of the country and almost the entire Bayelsa State has taken over the Otuoke residence of former President, Goodluck Jonathan, in Ogbia Local Government Area of the State. During his visit to the hometown of the former President to assess the situation on Friday, the Bayelsa State Governor, Duoye Diri lamented the level of destruction caused by what he described as an “attack by natural disaster” on the livelihood of Bayelsans. The Governor, who disclosed that Otuoke, which is the host community of a Federal University, had been submerged and most of the locals displaced, including Jonathan, further assured the people of the commitment of the State government to put in place machinery to provide relief materials and medical assistance to victims of the flood. While empathizing with Jonathan who he said is now also internally displaced as a result of the flood, the governor also visited the former president’s mother, Eunice Jonathan. Diri, however, solicited the help of well-meaning Bayelsans, corporate organisations and the federal government to enable the State overcome the present unfortunate situation. Flood takes over former president Jonathan’s home",

            "description": "KBP president Herman Basbaño says the approach of police visits to journalists' homes must be improved to ensure the safety of the media",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines – In light of anxiety in the media sector over the October 3 killing of hard-hitting broadcaster Percy Lapid, the Philippine National Police said it plans to hold safety dialogues with members of the media nationwide, a police deputy chief said on Saturday, October 22. Police Lieutenant General Rhodel Sermonia, the PNP’s Deputy Chief for Administration, made the announcement following a dialogue of the same nature with the media in Camp Crame on Saturday morning. “‘Yung inisyatibo na ginawa ng ating mabuting secretary dito po sa Camp Crame ay gagawin po nating nationwide. Pupuntahan po natin ‘yung mga provincial offices, at mga iba’t ibang region para makasalamuha rin ang ating mga kaibigan na media,” Sermonia told reporters. (The initiative that our [Interior] Secretary [Benhur Abalos] made here in Camp Crame will be done nationwide. We will go to the provincial offices and various regions so we can engage with our friends from the media.) The Department of the Interior and Local Government had earlier invited the media to a breakfast meeting on Saturday. The DILG oversees the national police and all police units in the country. “Kahit na ‘yung mga threat, kahit ano mang nare-receive ‘nyo na mga calls or mga messages ay ipagbigay alam ‘nyo kaagad sa aming kapulisan through our PIO sa mga probinsya at sa mga regional offices para matugunan po agad kung ano man po ‘yung mga banta na nakakarating sa inyo,” said Sermonia. (Threats you may receive, or calls or messages, let the police know through our Public Information Offices in the provinces, and in the regional offices, so that we can respond to whatever threat you may receive.) Addressing ‘trust issues’ After Lapid was killed, members of the media reported police visiting them in their houses with the intention to secure them. Some were not in uniform, as in the case of GMA reporter JP Soriano. Must Read To secure Metro journalists, police visit their houses, ask their contacts On October 15, the National Capital Region Police Office confirmed the visits, citing concern for the media personalities’ safety. NCRPO director Brigadier General Jonnel Estomo apologized for the incidents and said a probe would follow. Estomo also ordered police commanders to “stop and refrain from doing the same.” Speaking to the media after the Saturday morning dialogue, Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP) chairperson Ruperto Nicdao Jr. said the event was a good way to building trust between the media, the PNP, and the DILG. “In the past several days, there was an issue of trust. I think, and that’s because of the circumstances that happened – one of us died, who is a known critic of the government. Then, suddenly there were visitations, so of course we would get scared,” Nicdao said in a mix of English and Filipino. “So the issue there in my opinion is matter of trust. We were not trusting that the conduct of the visitations were for our benefit. So this exercise today I think, it’s a good step towards rebuilding, or building better trust between media and the PNP and DILG,” he added. KBP president Herman Basbaño also said that it was a good opportunity to revisit existing protocols to protect journalists. He said that the approach of home visits must be changed, because this could be abused especially since plainclothes cops have visited houses. “Anybody could just go to your house, tapos sabihin na, ‘Pulis din kami’…. So siguro ‘yun ang dapat na hanapan ng paraan na ma-improve at maiwasan ‘yung ganoon na abusuhin ng kung sino na may mga ibang intensyon,” said Basbaño. (Anybody could just go to your house and say, ‘We’re police, too’…. So perhaps we should find other ways to improve [protocols] and avoid this type of event where people with different intentions could abuse it.) Nicdao added that the visits should have been coordinated with the organizations. Must Read ‘Takot pamilya ko’: Why police home visits aren’t reassuring Percy Lapid’s alleged gunman Joel Escorial surrendered to authorities on October 18. He claimed that the order to kill Lapid allegedly came from inside the New Bilibid Prison, and that six of them behind the crime were paid a total of P550,000. In an extrajudicial confession – a confession made outside of a court or as part of judicial proceedings – Escorial named a certain Crisanto Villamor as their companion inside Bilibid who ordered the kill. He also mentioned a certain Christopher Bacoto as another companion. On October 20, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said Villamor had died inside the national penitentiary. On Saturday, the day of the media dialogue in Crame, the justice department released the National Bureau of Investigation’s initial report on Villamor’s death. According to the NBI report, Villamor died on October 18 with “no apparent sign of external physical injury.” – Rappler.com",

            "content": "ANTIPOLO, Philippines – After six straight close finishes, the UP Fighting Maroons finally coasted to a comfortable 25-point blowout, 76-51, at the expense of the hapless UST Growling Tigers at the Ynares Center in Antipolo City on Saturday, October 22. Terrence Fortea continued to fill in admirably for the ailing JD Cagulangan with a team-high 14 points on 3-of-5 shooting from three plus 3 rebounds and 3 assists, while Zavier Lucero completely filled the stat sheet with a massive line of 12 points, 5 boards, 4 dimes, 5 steals, and 3 blocks. It was a woeful start straight from tip-off for UST as UP fired off a 14-2 start and practically never looked back. With the Maroons still leading big at halftime, 38-24, Fortea added insult to injury by piling 11 of 14 of his points in the third period, peaking with his third triple at the 3:43 mark for the 28-point gap, 57-29. Although UST breathed new life to its offense with a huge 20-3 response bridging the last two frames, UP head coach Goldwin Monteverde deployed back his Mythical Five stars Lucero and Carl Tamayo to conspire for a 13-0 finishing kick that pushed the Maroons out of harm’s way for good. Tamayo, still reeling from a right ankle sprain, still provided a needed spark with 9 points in just as many minutes off the bench to help UP clinch a 6-1 record – momentarily above lone first-round tormentor NU (5-1). “From our first game to definitely our last game today, we really improved a lot on how we start the game,” Monteverde said. “I think we just have to work on our consistency, on how we start. We have to be more organized as a team, especially in the middle of the second quarter.” “Whatever happened in the first round, we’d work on it as a team.” Adama Faye returned from a one-game suspension with game-highs of 15 points and 13 rebounds in the Tigers’ sixth straight loss to drop to a 1-6 slate. Nic Cabañero – still heavily checked since his 33-point debut – limped to a 14-point finish on 6-of-17 shooting.

An officer in the video claimed the criminal element was killed during a gun duel with the attackers. “This is one of the kidnappers that was caught today while the DPO, Ayodele Lamido led the operations. “This one was gunned down after a fierce gun battle, while others escaped with bullet wounds”, he said. However, the Apostle took to his verified Twitter handle to antagonize the claim, saying the suspect was caught and handed over to the police. The clergyman, who insisted that the attackers were assassins, tackled the police for tagging them kidnappers. According to him, the suspect shouldn’t have been gunned down on the stop to pave way for thorough investigations. He wrote, “Lies, they weren’t kidnappers. He was caught and handed over and the police killed him immediately. Why? Why killing him on the spot? Who is trying to cover up traces?” Attack: Who’s trying to cover up – Suleman questions police for killing suspect",
